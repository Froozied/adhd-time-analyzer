# ADHD Time Analyzer

A more descriptive name would be: **"Anti-drift away ADHD Pomodoro time tracker."**
I looked for a similar free app, tried various Notion and Obsidian extensions, but found nothing. So, here it is.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **work-in-progress** version.

The main purpose of this project is to practice using **Nuxt Layers**. Eventually, I‚Äôd like to experiment with **two independent UI frontends**, and possibly also try out **different cloud backends**. The first version is based on **Firebase**, using **Auth**, **Firestore**, and **Nuxt UI**.

Alternatively, there's a demo version **without Firebase** ‚Äî in that case, logs are stored in the browser‚Äôs **local storage**. You can download your logs in json file using the button in the UI. Logs are optimized, so I estimate that **5MB of local storage** should be enough to store a few months of data.

## App Purpose

This app will probably only make sense to someone with ADHD ‚Äî someone who knows what it‚Äôs like to sit at a computer, completely forget about the world, food, or water, and stay there for hours.

A well-known method that helps with this is the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Unfortunately, when you have ADHD, you often either forget to start the timer or keep restarting it like hitting the snooze button on an alarm clock. You lose track of how long you've actually been working ‚Äî or not working.

_I built this app for myself to help with exactly that._

## Nuxt Layers

- app: Application Entry Layer, built with Nuxt UI components
- firebase: Firebase Layer, with:
  - Plugins: Initialization of Firebase app and authentication
  - Pinia Store: Manages authentication state
  - Components: Related to authentication UI and logic
  - Composables: Handle authentication and Firestore operations
- noop: `Noop` fallback layer used when Firebase is disabled
- **ANALYZER**: `Main app logic layer` ‚Äî all logic and calculations are handled in Pinia stores to keep logic UI-agnostic

## Logic in a nutshell

- `effective day start`: The first logs added during the day, with no more than a 2-minute gap between them, are counted as a streak to calculate this variable.
- `effective night gap auto detect`: Searches for a potential gap between logs after midnight and the `day start` to determine which logs belong to which day for statistics.
- The logic for dividing logs between days is in `useEdgeCases`.
- Variables used in the logic can be found in `~/analyzer/utils/config/logic.ts`.
- The statistics for today show the current tracked minutes since the beginning of the day and the variance between the tracked time and the time from the `effective day start`.
- Statistics for previous days are already simplified.

_I'll write more about this here someday._

> üôÉ The dictionaries used in the app are highly subjective and currently hardcoded in `~/analyzer/data`.

## Settings

`.env` variable to control which option is used:

```
USE_FIREBASE=false
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're working on the version **without Firebase**, it's better to simply delete the contents of the `firebase` directory.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `[vue-tsc]` doesn't handle this setup well ‚Äî or I haven‚Äôt figured out how to configure it properly yet.

## Development (no-DB version)

As mentioned above, if you're not using Firebase, you can either remove the Firebase layer entirely,
or disable TypeScript strict mode in the `nuxt.config.ts` file of the `App Layer`.

```bash
pnpm install
cd app
pnpm run dev
```

## Development (`Firebase Auth` + `Firestore` version)

Configure your Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).  
You will need to create a web app, initialize Authentication with the **Email/Password** sign-in method, create a user, and initialize Firestore.  
Then, download your app's configuration settings and copy them into the `firebaseConfig.ts` file.

Rename `utils/firebaseConfig.example.ts` to `utils/firebaseConfig.ts`, and update it with your app's information.

`.env` variable to control which option is used, turn it on:

```
USE_FIREBASE=true
```

Then, proceed as usual with Nuxt:

```bash
pnpm install
cd app
pnpm run dev
```

Start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
